## About the Manuscript

The manuscript at the centre of this project (Paris, Bibliothèque nationale de France, fonds français, 24432, hereafter fr24432) was produced in Paris in the middle of the fourteenth century.
It is the work of some 11 scribes, and contains some 87 texts across its 446 folios, all of which are written entirely or primarily in French.

## About the Project

This project presents a work-in-progress edition of the texts of fr24432 arising from my doctoral project, in which I conducted a combined textual and digital analysis of the manuscript.
The texts are separated into three groups according to their status: *Complete*, *Near Complete*, and *Incomplete*.

- *Complete* texts are those for which I have completed a full edition-quality encoding, which is presented via a web viewer.
  Links are given to editions I have published using these data.
- *Near Complete* texts can also be accessed via the web viewer, but should be approached with some caution as they are likely to contain errors and may not yet be wholly suitable for reading.
  Notes are given to set out those areas which are not yet complete.
- *Incomplete* texts are likely to contain numerous errors and inconsistencies, especially in the regularisation of punctuation, word-separation, and allographs.
  The data should therefore be treated with extreme caution.

All texts, whatever their status, are published in their current form in TEI, CSV, and TXT formats, in the hope that they will be of use to scholars, and will raise the profile of this fascinating manuscript.
